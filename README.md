### W2
1: r, g, and b is the decimal between 0 and 1, so you need to use float.

2: _bounce is a natural numbers record how many times the ball touch the cat or wall, so you need to use int.

3: 0.1 is a **double** , not a **float**. 0.1f is the **float**. After every line of code, you will need to add a ";".
